This 3D-printed / laser-cut design is created for contrast illumination techniques, aimed at microscopy enthusiasts and professionals.


# Why Improve Contrast?

In microscopy, many specimens—especially unstained or living samples—exhibit such low contrast that, despite an objective’s resolving power, important details remain nearly invisible.**Enhancing contrast is crucial for making these features observable without obscuring or damaging the specimen.**

Applying chemical dyes or fixatives can alter the sample, so microscopists have long sought ways to increase contrast in unstained material without exposing it to chemical or thermal “violence.” Although commonly used techniques—such as closing the condenser aperture diaphragm below 60% or lowering the substage condenser **do increase contrast, they also greatly diminish resolution and image sharpness.** As a result, finding contrast-enhancing methods that preserve specimen integrity and image quality remains central to microscopy.

# How to use it for 3D printing?


Simply download the correct STL file for your prints.

# Want to customize the design for your own specific objective or microscope?

> **Alternatively:**
>  You can download the OpenScad file (1 file for folder) and **very easily** edit each parameter of the filter.
 
- [ ] Download and install OpenScad (Free an open sofware for CAD files)
   - " https://openscad.org/downloads.html "
- [ ] Open the file using the program and look for parameters of the filter

- [ ] Simply edit to your needs
   - All measurement are in milimiters
- [ ] Generate a new STL file, save it and you are ready to print.



# How to use it for Laser cutting?

- [ ] Import the STL file into your laser cutting software:
   - Most popular laser cutting software supports importing STL files directly

- [ ] Scale and position the object:
   - Adjust the size and orientation of the object as needed

- [ ] Set material properties:
   - Input the thickness and type of material you'll be cutting
- [ ] Start the cutting 

# How to use a spider stop ?

Most microscopes have a way to add a filter in the optical path between the ilumination and the condenser.

The diameter of the opaque stop should be approximately 8mm for the 10X objective of N.A. 0.25 to approximately 15mm for objectives of N.A. 0.65.

> **MAKE SURE !**
>  1. Your condenser is as close to the sample as possible !
>  2. The Field Diafragm is at least 90 % open !
>  3. Beyond 0.65 NA Spider stop filters are harder to use and allign !
